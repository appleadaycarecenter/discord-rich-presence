The code updates your status every 5 seconds, it will also write the current files to the config file to save your data when the application is started next, so if your status is taking longer to update, please refer to the troubleshooting guide.

When you start the application, it will load default values from the config file. Push clear all to clear the values.

Set End To Current Time Plus x Seconds - This will set the end value to the current epoch time plus how many seconds you enter, ex: 86400 seconds is a day so if you set the start time to the current time and the end time to plus that many seconds, your rpc will show you ending your game in 23 hours.

* "On launch, the RPC doesn't start"

  * The RPC may not start immediately, please give it 2-5min to start. If it doesn't try changing some values.
 
* "RPC not displaying"

  * Make sure you tried the "On launch, the RPC doesn't start" fix first. If that doesn't help then go to User Settings > Game Activity and make sure "Display currently running game as a status message" is toggled on or green.
